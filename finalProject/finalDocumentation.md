# C.A.R.A (Complex Augmented Reality and Arduino)

### Introduction
C.A.R.A is an Augmented Reality solution for a traditional museum to help engage youth of ages 16-20, which have a short attention span. The product employs technology such as the tablet and Arduino. The tablet is used for Augmented Reality elements, which provide features to the user such as zooming and rotating the historical object while the Arduino provides a “Push Button” switch which changes the complexity of the information provided about the historical object. Through these interactions, we allow the user to have control over the experience they want to have during the museum tour. 

### Methodology
**Augmented Reality Part**

Through Photogrammetry of the historical objects and rendering them in the “Agisoft Metashape,” we will create the 3D models to run in “Unity,” allowing the user to rotate and zoom in the object. The user at the museum will be scanning a QR code to load the object into the tablet. Near the object there will be touch screen buttons for the information to be displayed about the object. 
The user will be able to change the amount of information that will be displayed about the object. The features of zooming and rotating will still be available but more information buttons will appear on the tablet screen. 

**Arduino Part**

Soldered Arduino will be set up in each station with a couple of push buttons. One of them is to receive assistance in case the program or tablet malfunctions. Another button will allow the user to provide feedback to the museum. 

### Final Remarks
Through the implementation of C.A.R.A, we hope to attract our youth audience using Augmented Reality Tablets and Arduino. Having features like zooming and rotating and relevant information which the user can adapt to their own interest. The addition of help and feedback also helps the user help the museum have better experience for future comers.
