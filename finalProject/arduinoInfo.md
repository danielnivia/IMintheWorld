# Arduino Schematic and Circuit

For the presentation of the final project we created an Arduino circuit to show complexity levels. Although our final concept might not use the Arduino in the same way we intended, the idea is to show some physical feedback to the user at this stage of the project. Below we share the schematic of the circuit and a photo of the circuit.
